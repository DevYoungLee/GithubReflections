You might want to use a remote repository rather than keeping it local if you are collaborating on a project and want your code to be shared or reviewed. Also it is an easy way to make sure your code gets saved in a cloud in case something goes wrong with your computer.
You might want to pull changes manually rather than Git automatically staying up-to-date with your remote repository because there may be commits in the remote that you do not want, need, or may interfere with the local repository.
A branch is used when you when you create a separate branch for a commit. It is useful when trying experimental features, or adding a separate version without worrying about how this may affect the master branch. A clone is used when you want to copy someone else's repository on GitHub onto your local repository
