You might want to use a remote repository rather than keeping it local if you are collaborating on a project and want your code to be shared or reviewed. Also it is an easy way to make sure your code gets saved in a cloud in case something goes wrong with your computer.
You might want to pull changes manually rather than Git automatically staying up-to-date with your remote repository because there may be commits in the remote that you do not want, need, or may interfere with the local repository.
A branch is used when you when you create a separate branch for a commit. It is useful when trying experimental features, or adding a separate version without worrying about how this may affect the master branch. A clone is used when you want to copy someone else's repository on GitHub onto your local repository
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that you can make changes to it without affecting the repository on GitHub. Also, being locally stores, you can update make changes offline. Finally, having a version stores locally allows you a check before pushing any changes to the origin in case there are are conflicts. Further, this allows you to use git diff to see any changes that you have made compared to the origin/master.
