When you initialize a repository a .git file is created in the file to show that it is now a git repository. You need to do this if you plan to make any commits in the file in the future. And we know how useful commits and version-control is!
The working directory is the current directory that the project is being worked on. The repository is the git directory that I have the option to commit, upload, clone. The staging area is an intermediate step between the two. It allows me to choose what files I think are important to put in the repository (worth saving, having version-control). In other words, it allows me to leave out files from the repository I think would be useless to commit.
